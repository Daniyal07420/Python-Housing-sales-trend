****🏠 Housing Sales Analysis Dashboard****

This project showcases a Housing Sales Data Analysis performed using Python and visualized with Power BI.
It demonstrates how data analytics and visualization techniques can be combined to extract key insights from real estate datasets.

**📊 Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to analyze housing sales data to understand how various factors — such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, parking spaces, and proximity to main roads — affect property prices.
The analysis was performed using Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) and the final interactive dashboard was designed in Power BI.

**🧠 Key Insights**

Houses with more bedrooms and bathrooms tend to have higher prices.

Main road proximity significantly impacts housing prices.

The number of stories has a noticeable effect on pricing trends.

Preferred area properties are generally more expensive.

The price trend by area shows certain spikes, possibly due to high-value properties in specific zones.


**🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

****📁 Project Workflow*******

**Data Preparation**
Loaded housing dataset using pandas.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data (handled missing values, formatted columns).

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Performed descriptive statistics and feature-wise visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.

**Visualization in Power BI**
Imported cleaned dataset into Power BI.
Built visualizations such as:
Bedrooms vs Bathrooms overview
Price comparison by preferred area
Impact of parking and main road
Price trend by area

**Dashboard Design**
Added KPIs: Total Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Parking, and Price.
Applied color themes and consistent formatting for professional presentation.
